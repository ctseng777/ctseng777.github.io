  Mechanistic interpretability studies of autoregressive (AR) models are abundant, while studies on diffusion models (DLLM) remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the arithmetic behaviors of Dream-v0-Instruct-7B (Dream). Future work includes causal study of DLLM to isolate the arithmetic neurons [1], particularly approximation operations, extending the evaluation to larger benchmarks to gain statistical significance and providing mechanistic interpretability study tools to the community.
