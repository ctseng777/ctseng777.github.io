  In the era of data-driven intelligence, the paradox of data abundance and annotation scarcity has emerged as a critical bottleneck in the advancement of machine learning. This paper gives a detailed overview of Active Learning (AL), which is a strategy in machine learning that helps models achieve better performance using fewer labeled examples. It introduces the basic concepts of AL and discusses how it is used in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, transfer learning, and real-world applications. The paper focuses on important research topics such as uncertainty estimation, handling of class imbalance, domain adaptation, fairness, and the creation of strong evaluation metrics and benchmarks. It also shows that learning methods inspired by humans and guided by questions can improve data efficiency and help models learn more effectively. In addition, this paper talks about current challenges in the field, including the need to rebuild trust, ensure reproducibility, and deal with inconsistent methodologies. It points out that AL often gives better results than passive learning, especially when good evaluation measures are used. This work aims to be useful for both researchers and practitioners by providing key insights and proposing directions for future progress in active learning.
