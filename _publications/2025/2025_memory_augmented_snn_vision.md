  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer biological plausibility and energy efficiency, yet systematic investigation of memory augmentation strategies remains limited. We present five-model ablation studies, integrating Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons, Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL), Hopfield networks, and Hierarchical Gated Recurrent Networks (HGRN) on N-MNIST. Our study shows: baseline SNNs naturally form organized group of neurons called structured assemblies (silhouette 0.687±0.012) that work together to process information in a neural network. Individual augmentations introduce trade-offs: SCL improves accuracy (+0.28%) but disrupts clustering (drop to silhouette 0.637±0.015); HGRN provides consistent gains (+1.01% accuracy, 170.6× efficiency); full integration achieves synergistic balance (silhouette 0.715±0.008, 97.49±0.10% accuracy, 1.85±0.06μJ, 97.0% sparsity). Optimal results emerge from architectural balance rather than individual optimization, establishing design principles for neuromorphic computing.
