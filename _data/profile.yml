    My research centers on advancing AI-assisted mathematical proof, autoformalization, formal verification, and interpretable reasoning as interrelated approaches to aligning AI systems with human values. These directions directly address the pressing challenge of LLM opacity and the need for provably beneficial AI, as emphasized by CHAI’s mission [Hilton, 2024]. While large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, they largely remain “black boxes”—deep, inscrutable systems whose reasoning processes are hidden [Jiang et al., 2023b]. This opacity poses serious risks in safety-critical domains [Han et al., 2021], eroding trust and enabling subtle errors to go unnoticed. My recent research on LLM-as-judge confirms the unreliability of LLM-based evaluations widely adopted in research settings [Feuer et al., 2025]. My research: StreetMath, investigates approximation behavior in LLMs and reveals their divergence from human reasoning patterns in everyday settings. https://ctseng777.github.io/assets/pdf/StreetMath_2025.pdf
