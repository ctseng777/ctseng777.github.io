  <p>
    I am an independent researcher, focusing on AI4Math and model interpretability research. 
    My research interests lie at the intersection of large language models, mathematical reasoning, and model interpretability.
  </p>
  <p>
    I completed my MS in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and my undergraduate degree 
    at National Central University. Looking for research opportunities/collaborations.
